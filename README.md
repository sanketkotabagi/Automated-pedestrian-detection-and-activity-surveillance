# Automated-pedestrian-detection-and-activity-surveillance
This repository contains the implementation of the project "Novel Pedestrian Detection and Suspicious Activity Recognition", which applies machine learning techniques (RandomForest) to classify pedestrian actions and identify suspicious behaviors, including Hit, Push, Kick, Punch, Robbery, and Shooting. Developed as a 5th-semester engineering mini-project, it utilizes the HMDB Human Activity Recognition dataset, a large-scale collection of realistic videos from movies and online sources, offering a diverse range of human activities for effective model training and evaluation.
